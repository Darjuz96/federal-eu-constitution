# Preamble

We, the Peoples of Europe, guided by the common values enshrined in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of 1789, hereby establish a union based on justice, freedom, and independence.

Determined to preserve and enhance our cultural heritage and to promote the well-being and security of all citizens, we reaffirm our commitment to a just society in which the fundamental rights of all individuals are safeguarded, where freedoms are honored, and where the rule of law prevails.

Determined to maintain the sovereignty of our nations within the framework of a united federal government, we establish this Union to provide for the common defense, promote the general welfare, and secure the blessings of peace and prosperity for ourselves and future generations.

In respect for the principles of popular sovereignty, we assert that all power emanates from the people, and through this Constitution, we bind ourselves to a democratic order that respects the diversity and independence of our Member States, while striving to build an indivisible Union dedicated to the common good.

In this spirit, we Europeans solemnly adopt this Constitution as the supreme law of the land.
